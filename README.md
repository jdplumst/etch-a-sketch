This is an Etch-a-Sketch game made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The Etch-a-Sketch is a 16x16 grid of white squares. When initially hovering over a tile, it turns into a random color. After turning into a random color, it becomes 10% darker every time the mouse hovers over it until it eventually becomes a black tile.
