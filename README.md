This is an Etch-a-Sketch game made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The Etch-a-Sketch is an nxn grid of white squares. When initially hovering over a tile, it turns into a random color. After turning into a random color, it becomes 10% darker every time the mouse hovers over it until it eventually becomes a black tile.

The grid is initially 16x16 but can be changed by clicking the Set Size button. For example, it can be changed to an 8x8 grid by simply entering 8 into the prompt after clicking the button.
